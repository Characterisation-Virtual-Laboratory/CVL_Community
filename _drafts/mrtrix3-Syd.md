## MRtrix3 Workshop

Official [MRtrix3](https://www.mrtrix.org/) workshop will be held this year in Sydney, Australia.



MRtrix3 provides a set of tools to perform various types of diffusion MRI analyses (preprocessing, voxel-level modelling, fiber tracking, group analysis, visualization). It is designed with consistency, performance, and stability in mind. It is developed and maintained by a team of experts in the field, fostering an active community of users from diverse backgrounds.

This 4 day hands-on workshop will cover the theory and practice of diffusion analysis, covering the range of techniques available within MRtrix3. This course is aimed at both new and existing users of MRtrix3, covering basic functionality as well as the latest analysis methods. The topics covered are intended for researchers in basic science and/or clinical research. **After completing this MRtrix3 course, participants should be able to process, analyze, and visualize their own diffusion MRI data sets using MRtrix3 tools**.

The [Australian National Imaging Facility (NIF)](https://anif.org.au/) is a partner to the [Characterisation Data enhanced Virtual Laboratory (CDeVL) project](https://www.cvl.org.au/), leading the training activities for the Characterisation Community in Australia. Training focuses on FAIR principles of data sharing (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and data processing. NIF through the CDeVL supports research in Australia by proving open access to research infrastructure. NIF and the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) have provided a financial contribution to the execution of the MRtrix3 workshop, enabling a reduction of the workshop registration fees for all attendees.

In addition, the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) is offering up to ten AU $500 scholarships to student and/or academics based in Australia, to assist with a further discount on the workshop registration. Apply by sending your motivation and goals to attend to get the discount before March 23 (note that this is earlier than closure of registrations to the workshop itself).
