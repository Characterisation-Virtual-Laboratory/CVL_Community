## Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)

The CVL is a nationally funded software infrastructure collaboration
to make scientific tools for image analysis and processing, available freely
and cloud-ready. The [CVL is also a community](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/about) who support training
and best data management practices.
