List of tutorials ordered alphabetically.

### Computational Bioimaging

From images (both light and electron microscopy) to data. This course will
cover the process of dealing with microscopy data, converting between formats,
analysing images in a clear and reproducible fashion and preparing images for
publication. Includes FIJI, Python and OMERO. By Matthew Hartley 2015, from John
Innes Centre, JIC. [Online tutorial](http://training.scicomp.jic.ac.uk/docs/bioimaging_course_book/index.html).
Labeled for beginners in microscopy analysis.
