# Tutorials from external resources

## List of all tutorials ordered by Alphabet name

### The Image Data Resource

* The Image Data Resource (IDR) publishes “reference image” datasets supporting conventional peer-reviewed publications and integrates them with other imaging datasets for cross-dataset querying of metadata (e.g. genes, phenotypes, small molecules) and re-analysis. [Submission of datasets to IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/submission.html) and an [IDR metadata example](https://github.com/IDR/idr-metadata).

### FreeSurfer

* If you want to learn [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Tutorials) the documentation is ready to be explored.
