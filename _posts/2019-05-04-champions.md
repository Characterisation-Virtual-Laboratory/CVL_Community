The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) Champions are a community of researchers, university lecturers, and bioimaging professionals taking part in a skills development program. The program is developed to enhance the national characterisation computing infrastructure and apply FAIR data principles to research workflows, by upskilling scientists and bioimaging professionals for continuation of these goals.

# CVL Champions Program 2019

The CVL Champions Program's aim is to create a community that stimulates network engagement across Australian characterisation facilities to raise the awareness of FAIR data principles and access to the national characterisation computing infrastructure.

The CVL Champions is part of the Characterisation Data enhanced Virtual Laboratory (CDeVL) project, funded by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

## Why be a CVL champion?

* Becoming a CVL champion provides access to networking, advanced skills development, and demonstrates service to the profession.
* The program provides the Champions with all the ready-to-use materials and knowledge required so that they can confidently re-deliver similar workshops from the Program in their own institutions.
* The CVL champions are a community exemplar working together remotely and in person during two months (September/October 2019), so the time commitment is balanced.
* Community members who are already involved in training can, and are encouraged to take part in the Program to improve their current teaching methodology and to further extend their network.
* The program offers a two day in person meeting, *with all costs paid*.

# Application

We are looking for a representative cohort of enthusiastic people, who are keen to learn and be the leaders of the national Characterisation training network. Champions are the engine across the Australian Characterisation community to uplift data skills and specialists skills across characterisation experts and users. *Women applicants are specially encouraged to apply*.

The group of selected champions will meet in person for two days of networking and training in October 1st and 2nd, location TBA.

## Application timeline

* Applications open on 18th of June, 2019.
* Videoconference information session on 17th of July, 2019.
* Applications close on 31st of July, 2019.
* Selected applicants will be contacted on 9th of August, 2019.

## Requirements

* Commit to attending and participating in the three programmed events, 2 online and 1 in person (see program below).
* Commit to continuation of the training effort for at least until the end of 2020.
* Provide at least 2 trainings sessions a year, one of which has to be part of the CVL trainings.
* Promote the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory and best data management practices. * All participants will get access the CVL infrastructure.
