# Champions Program 2019

The CVL Champions program is a community of researchers, university lecturers,
and health professionals who will be part of a skills development program. The
program's aim is to enhance the use of the Characterisation infrastructure
to connect research with instrument and reproducible research workflows.

## Application
We are looking for a representative cohort of people who are keen to learn about data best practices and give training in return in their domain expertise. Women applicants are specially encouraged to apply. The group of selected champions will meet in person for two days in October, *with all costs paid*.

### Application process

* Open applications from 18th of June, 2019.
* Zoom information session 17th of July, 2019.
* Applications close on 31st of July, 2019.
* Selected applicants will be contacted on 9th of August, 2019.

### Requirements

* Commit to continuation of the training effort for at least until end of 2020.

## Description of the Champions Program 2019

### Why being a Characterisation champion?

The Characterisation champions are a community exemplar who will work together remotely and in person during two months (September/October 2019). We expect this selected group will self-coordinate, with the support of the Characterisation Training Coordinator. Coordination is needed to keep all members updated about training activities, maintenance of training materials, and encouragement of best data practices for the broader community.

### Champions in person meeting agenda
Champions will have 2 online meetings prior the in-person event to set SMART goals.
* Zoom meetings and discussion, September 9th and 23rd, 2019.
The group of selected champions will meet in person, *with all costs paid*,
 for an introductory training program of 2 days.
* In person workshop October 1st and 2nd, 2019. Location TBA

The program for the in-person meeting will be:
* General introduction covering the data life cycle, the FAIR principles and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards.
* Stories of CVL users.
* All participants will get on board to use the CVL if they haven't yet.
* Get started preparing open access materials for the Characterisation community.
