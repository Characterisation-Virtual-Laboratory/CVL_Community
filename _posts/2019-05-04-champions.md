The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) Community (Neuroscience,
Microscopy, Structural Biology, Atom Probe, Neutron Techniques) is providing a
unique opportunity to upskilling scientists and bioimaging professionals.
The CVL Champions are a community of researchers, university lecturers, and
bioimaging professionals taking part in a skills development program. The
program is designed to provide guidance, methods and tips for developing and
delivering quality, impactful training. With the new CVL Champions we aim
to enhance the national characterisation training network and encourage the application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles to research workflows.

*The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory is a free cloud-based virtual desktop to perform analysis of complex image and microscopy data. It is essentially a virtual computer with all the software you need pre-installed, all embedded in a web browser accessible using AAF (Australian Access Federation), and connected to a HPC (high performance computing) infrastructure to boost your analysis workflows. [Read more about the CVL](../about).*

    **TL;DR** / Summary :
    1. Get all costs paid to participate in a train the trainer event.
    2. Form a community of engagement and maintenance of training resources.
    3. Commit to deliver workshops next year, at least one of these should be using the CVL.

# CVL Champions Program 2019

The CVL Champions Program's aim is to create a community that stimulates network engagement across [Australian characterisation facilities](../AustralianCharacterisationFacilities) to raise the awareness of [FAIR data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/fairdata) principles and access to the national characterisation computing infrastructure. The CVL Champions is part of the Characterisation Data enhanced Virtual Laboratory (CDeVL) project, funded by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

## Invitation

The CVL Community (Neuroscience, Microscopy, Structural Biology, Atom Probe,
Neutron Techniques) is providing a unique opportunity for both external and
internal staff / HRD students to develop their training skills in a 2 day
workshop 1- 2 October (all costs paid). The workshop is designed to provide
guidance, methods and tips for developing and delivering quality, impactful
training; whilst also encouraging attendees to become reflective practitioners,
able to seek and act upon feedback and try new modes of training. To join you
need to have enthusiasm for delivering knowledge to others. The training we
provide is highly interactive in nature. Throughout the workshop participants
are encouraged to bring their thoughts and voice into all discussions; sharing
experiences and swapping ideas. We will also facilitate networking between
the participants, regardless of their areas of expertise.

If you think this workshop might be of interest to someone else, please
forward this opportunity. Registration open on 18 June 2019 and close 31 July 2019.

## Why be a CVL champion?

* Becoming a CVL champion provides access to networking, advanced skills development, and demonstrates service to the profession.
* The program provides the Champions with all the ready-to-use materials and knowledge required so that they can confidently re-deliver similar workshops from the Program in their own institutions.
* The CVL champions are a community exemplar working together remotely and in person during two months (September/October 2019), so the time commitment is balanced.
* Community members who are already involved in training can, and are encouraged to take part in the Program to improve their current teaching methodology and to further extend their network.
* The program offers a two day in person meeting, *with all costs paid*.

# Application

We are looking for a representative cohort of enthusiastic people, who are keen to learn and be the leaders of the national Characterisation training network. Applicants at all career stages are welcome to apply. Champions are the engine across the Australian Characterisation community to uplift data skills and specialist skills across characterisation users.
We also strongly encourage members of groups that are underrepresented in science to apply. Diversity is one of our explicit evaluation criteria, and we work hard to try and make this community a comfortable and welcoming environment for all.

The group of selected champions will meet in person for two days of networking and training on 1-2 October 2019, location TBA.

## Application timeline
