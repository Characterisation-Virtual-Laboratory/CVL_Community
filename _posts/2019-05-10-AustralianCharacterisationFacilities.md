Characterisation refers to the general process of probing and measuring the structures and properties of materials at the micro, nano and atomic scales.

# The Australian Characterisation Facilities.

Characterisation refers to the general process of probing and measuring the structures and properties of materials at the micro, nano and atomic scales. It is essential across natural, agricultural, physical, life and biomedical sciences and engineering. Characterisation facilities, provide researchers in Australian universities, research centres, and industries with critical infrastructure, including both instrumentation and expertise, to enable quality research outcomes in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

These facilities are a key capability that underpin flagship Australian research collaborations including ARC Centres of Excellence which are both significant users and partners in the development of future characterisation techniques and applications. The Australian Characterisation community and our partners bring together thousands of researchers who are driving the future of Australian imaging and innovation.

The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) is operated by MASSIVE in partnership with Monash University, Microscopy Australia, ANSTO, NIF, University of Sydney, University of Queensland, University of Western Australia, and University of Wollongong.
