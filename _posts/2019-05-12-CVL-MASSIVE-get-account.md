Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) desktop service is
provided as a national resource by MASSIVE ([Multi-Modal Australian Sciences Imaging and Visualisation Environment](https://www.massive.org.au/)). MASSIVE
provides researchers with the computing resources and tools to
apply high-throughput parallel processing and deep learning
techniques to solve research questions, and allows researchers
to more effectively extract knowledge from scientific data.
