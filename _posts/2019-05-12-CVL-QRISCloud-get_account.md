The Characterisation Virtual Desktop (CVL) is a federated resource available in Australia through its partners. In Queensland, the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation ([QCIF](https://www.qcif.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}) supports and develops the CVL and provides access to users via its [QRISCloud service](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/about-qriscloud){:target="_blank"}. QCIF, in collaboration with UQ's Research Computing Center ([UQRCC](https://rcc.uq.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}), has launched a high throughput [computer cluster](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/services/compute){:target="_blank"} called Awoonga. Awoonga is where the CVL is currently located.

The CVL desktop enables researchers to keep data nearby and leverage a local system for imaging workloads. Keep in mind the CVL in Qld is currently in **testing mode** and we appreciate any feedback you can provide.

# Getting an account to use the CVL in Queensland

The process to get an account to use the CVL in Queensland requires three steps. An account on QRIScloud, request access to Awoonga and request access to the CVL users group.

## Getting your account sorted

You will only do this process once. **Auto provision** is a logic process
that should take you automatically to the next step.

There are three possibilities:

1. QCIF members will see a “Enable QRIScloud CVL” button (which makes them a member of the CVL-Users group and gives them access to Awoonga.
2. Non-members will see text telling them to try another location or submit a ticket to QRIScloud Support requesting a CVL account on Awoonga.
3. If they already have QRIScloud CVL (i.e. access to Awoonga and are a member of the CVL-Users group), they will be redirected to the CVL Workbench directly.

### The same process in more details

The first two steps are required if you do not have an Awoonga account already.
1. Register for a [QRIScloud Account](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/){:target="_blank"} using your institution Australia Access Federation (AAF) credentials.
1.  [Register to use the Awoonga](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/index.php/services){:target="_blank"}. Located in the second column under QRISCompute.
1. Join the CVL users group. Please include a meaningful description in the [form](https://services.qriscloud.org.au/access/336df5742362455f923d7ea9efb39133/member){:target="_blank"}. - It takes about one day (probably less) to set your account with the right access permissions.

# Access the CVL in Queensland
Once you have your account, you can access the CVL.

1. We recommend using Chrome and then click on the link [https://cvl.qriscloud.org.au](https://cvl.qriscloud.org.au){:target="_blank"} and select *CVL@Qld (Beta)*.
1. When asked, please login with your institutional credentials through AAF. You can check the box to remember your details, or it will ask you every time you login.
1. Once you see a Windows called "Strudel Web" Click on *Awoonga-TESLA-K20M*, then click on *Launch* and wait.
1. A desktop will start when state is checked, and the **Show Desktop** is available.
1. A new tab will open with the CVL and its applications, which you can find on the top menu.
