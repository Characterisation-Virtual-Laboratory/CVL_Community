The University of Queensland’s Research Computing Centre (RCC)
is building the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)
desktop to enable UQ researchers to keep data nearby and
leverage a local system for imaging workloads.

# Getting started with CVL at QRISCloud

The process to get an account to use the CVL at QRISCloud
requires a few steps, starting with gaining access to
computing resources. Keep in mind the CVL at QRISCloud desktop
is currently in **testing mode**. We are testing two different options to get
access. Your feedback is welcome.

## Option 1 - Step by step

The first two steps are required if you do not have an Awoonga account already.
1. Register for a [QRIScloud Account](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/) using your institution Australia Access Federation (AAF) credentials.
1.  [Register to use the Awoonga cluster](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/index.php/services) to get access to the CVL at Awoonga.
1. Join the CVL project. Please include a meaningful description in the [form](https://services.qriscloud.org.au/access/336df5742362455f923d7ea9efb39133/member). - It takes about one day (probably less) to set your account with the right access.
1. Go to [strudel web](https://cvl.qriscloud.org.au) and select *uqcvl-auth*.
  * If asked, please login with your institutional credentials through AAF.
  * Click on *Awoonga-SpecialQ*, then *Launch*
  * A desktop will start with state checked, click *Show Desktop*.

## Option 2 - Test auto-provision

**Auto provision is similar to the steps above** we are testing a logic process
that should take you automatically to the next step.

The QRIScloud CVL auto-provisioning page is:

[https://services.qriscloud.org.au/services/cvl](https://services.qriscloud.org.au/services/cvl)

There are three possibilities:

1. QCIF members will see a “Enable QRIScloud CVL” button (which makes them a member of the CVL-Users group and/or gives them access to Awoonga, depending on which/both they do not yet have).
2. Non-members will see text telling them to try another location or submit a ticket to QRIScloud Support.
3. If they already have QRIScloud CVL (i.e. access to Awoonga and is a member of CVL-Users), they will be redirected to the CVL Workbench.

## Contact details

QRISCloud is currently being tested and will become available
in the next months. You can read more about this deployment <a target="_blank" href="https://rcc.uq.edu.au/article/2019/02/rcc-works-virtual-lab-imaging-research">here</a>.</p>
