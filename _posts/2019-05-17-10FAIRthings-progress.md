# Global Sprint

The Mozilla(moz://a) sprint idea is a month-long open opportunity for projects and communities to collaborate, hack, and learn together anytime during the month of May.

## Mozilla-Library Carpentry Global Sprint, May 2019

The sprint has the aim to improve and develop Library Carpentry material. Under that umbrella we will work on the [Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Things](https://librarycarpentry.org/Top-10-FAIR/).
These are a number of brief guides created to help discipline-based communities understand the FAIR Principles.
