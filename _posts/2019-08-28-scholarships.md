Travel scholarships for researchers in Australia, working with complex image analysis (characterisation).

# Travel scholarships
Limited travel scholarships to attend a workshop are provided by the CDEVL project
 (Characterisation Data Enhanced Virtual Laboratory) in the form of travel grants, which will cover the cost of travel (airfare, train, bus,
taxi, accommodation). These are provided up to
 specified caps as follows:

- up to A$500 for any participant coming from a state other than where the workshop is being held.
- up to A$800 for participants coming from WA or NT.

You may apply for a travel scholarship (at least 3 weeks before the event) by answering the following questions:

1. Name and date of the workshop
1. Brief research domain, career level, institution
1. What is your motivation for attending this workshop?
1. Brief reasons why your institution cannot fund your attendance
1. How your attendance will make a difference to your career?
1. Commit to share your experience after the workshop,
for example, a video or short story (a month after the workshop) or instruct or facilitate a workshop (in the following 6 months).
