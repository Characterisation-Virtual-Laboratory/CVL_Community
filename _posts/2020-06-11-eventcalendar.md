This is a calendar of events in Australia and international that are open for anyone to attend. Most of the events are from [NCRIS](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) partners. If your event is national and/or open for participants outside of your institution, we would be happy to add those events to this calendar for the purpose of advertising.

The training work package of the Characterisation Commons at Scale (ACCS) is continuously looking to interlink portfolios of training events, experiences and resources aimed at upskilling and develop skills and capability around:
- domain specific: data analysis/processing
- data management and best practices
- software/workflows development and best practices
