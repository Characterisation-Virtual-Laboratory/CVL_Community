Online workshop
Date: 03 June, 2020
Duration: 1 hour
Centre for Advanced Imaging (CAI)
Instructors:
    * Dr Steffen Bollmann, 7T National Imaging Facility Fellow
    * Dr Saskia Bollmann, UQ Postdoctoral Research Fellow

The workshop was targetted for the CAI community. As an introduction to Git and GitLab.

Feedback was great:

    “The presentation was fantastic. I loved the relaxed, enthusiastic style, and the counterpoint of practical examples (Saskia) vs technical background and terminology (Steffen) was perfectly realised. I learned some features of git, history, and background that I wasn't aware of.”
