## Research Data Culture
To be data-driven requires an overarching data culture that couples several elements, including high-quality trustable data, broad and relevant access, data literacy and fit data-driven decision-making processes.

As a research intensive university UQ works hard on enabling high quality research. First, our infrastructure foresees and enables data collection, data management, maintenance, archiving and security. The line items add up, but none of these would be valuable if researchers like you, donâ€™t know what is available or how to access it.

The purpose of this forum is to inform the UQ research community of the resources available and invite collaboration from other research institutions.

### Program

Speakers have made their presentations available. Here you will find resources such: Training, computing and support offerings in software, research skills, publishing and research management. Not only institutional but at a national scale too.
Remember, if done well, a thriving data-driven team can reap huge rewards, and that is what we envision.
