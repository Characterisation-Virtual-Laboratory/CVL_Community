The RDM provides the UQ research community with a collaborative, safe and secure large-scale storage facility to practice good stewardship of research data.

## What are we going to learn?

At the end of this session you will be able to:

* Create one or more UQRDM records
    * One of your UQRDM records will be connected to HPC collections
* Reuse a set of guidelines to use HPC collections
* Be motivated to use data management best practices
* Go back to Data management recommendations
* Describe what the concept of FAIR means
* Observe how the CVL desktop works
