/30days


Dear attendees,


Thanks for registering for the upcoming FIJI intro workshop. This is part of the Characterisation Data Enhanced project with the aim of building national awareness of data management and analysis capability and capacity.

To level set expectations for this workshop we requested you to contact Cameron Novell with your questions and data samples. We aim to use this space to answer your especific questions about data analysis and offer you tools to do so. Please be aware of the different user levels that might be among participants and that we will try as best as possible to cover the basics.

If you are looking for more advaced ways to use FIJI as analysis tool, we hope you got the chance to contact CBNS to join the advanced FIJI workshop. Please also refer to the CVL community website for a list of online tutorials, which includes a link to Cameron's FIJI user guide.

For Monday, make sure you bring your laptop with FIJI installed, you can download sample data provided by Matthias.

We would ask you to kindly work in pairs with anyone who is not able to bring a laptop or who did not request a CVL account before hand.

if you are using the CVL at awoonga we highly recommend you to become familiar with the user guide https://www.qriscloud.org.au/support/qriscloud-documentation/92-awoonga-user-guide and ask questions if you need.




Each Awoonga user is allocated a directory on the /30days file system. It is present on the Awoonga login nodes and the Awoonga compute nodes. The main purpose is to hold large data sets on a temporary basis while you are computing against them. It is designed to be a data staging area.

Thanks for attending this session hosted by the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL). Please complete the following feedback form before leaving [https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/ueCsAo](https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/ueCsAo)

Everything we do today is available online. It is your responsibility to select what is more important for you.
Suggested resources will be listed at the end of each presentation.

This is a live notepad the link is here: https://demo.codimd.org/s/SJqgnL4C4
After the workshop, you can view and save this notepad with the important links and information as a [PDF](https://gitprint.com/Characterisation-Virtual-Laboratory/CVL_Community/blob/master/_posts/CMM19/2019-06-05-UQRDM-FAIR.md).

## Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)

Nationally funded software infrastructure collaboration
to make scientific tools for image analysis and processing, available freely and cloud-ready. The [CVL is also a community](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/about) of experts who support training and best practices.

## The Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis (CMM)

Is an interdisciplinary research, teaching and service centre based at The University of Queensland (UQ).
CMM Actively supports and initiates microscopy & microanalysis.

## UQ Research Data Manager (RDM)

The RDM provides the UQ research community with a collaborative, safe and secure large-scale storage facility to practice good stewardship of research data.

## What are we going to learn?

At the end of this session you will be able to:

* Create one or more UQRDM records
    * One of your UQRDM records will be connected to HPC collections
* Reuse a set of guidelines to use HPC collections
* Be motivated to use data management best practices
* Go back to Data management recommendations
* Describe what the concept of FAIR means
* Observe how the CVL desktop works
