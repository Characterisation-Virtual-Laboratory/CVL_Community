Thanks for registering for the FIJI intro workshop. This is part of the Characterisation Data Enhanced project with the aim of building national awareness of data management and analysis capability and capacity.

We aim to use this space to answer your especific questions about data analysis in microscopy using FIJI and offer you tools to do so. We will try as best as possible to cover the basics. If you are looking for more advaced ways to use FIJI as analysis tool, please refer to the [CVL community website for a list of online tutorials](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/other-tutorials/), which includes a link to Cameron's FIJI user manual.

## Using FIJI during the workshop

- Make sure to bring your laptop with FIJI installed or have accessed the CVL, once before.
- You can download sample data provided by Matthias, if you are using your own laptop.
- We would ask you to kindly work in pairs with anyone who is not able to bring a laptop or who did not request a CVL account before hand.
- If you are using the CVL at awoonga we highly recommend you to become familiar with the [Awoonga user guide](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/support/qriscloud-documentation/92-awoonga-user-guide) and ask questions if you need.

## Instructor

* Cameron Novell from Monash University

## Materials

* [FIJI manual by Cameron Nowell](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/NzLifYbQdDb43Fq) and [images](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/3tutoG9lAYPFC4v).

## Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)

Nationally funded software infrastructure collaboration
to make scientific tools for image analysis and processing, available freely and cloud-ready. The [CVL is also a community](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/about) who support each other in training and best practices.

### Using CVL at Awoonga

Each Awoonga user is allocated a directory on the /30days file system. The main purpose is to hold large datasets on a temporary basis while you are computing against them.
Create a project directory in this folder for analysis, and read more about Awoonga [user guide](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/support/qriscloud-documentation/92-awoonga-user-guide).
