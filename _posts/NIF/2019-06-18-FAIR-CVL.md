# Introduction to FAIR data

The National Image Facility annual meeting is happening on 18-21 June 2019 in
Brisbane. This meeting starts with a FAIR training event, and on boarding
participants to use the CVL desktop.

## Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)

The CVL is a nationally funded software infrastructure collaboration
to make scientific tools for image analysis and processing, available freely
and cloud-ready. The [CVL is also a community](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/about) of experts who support training
and best data management practices.

## Workshop preparation

In preparation for the NIF workshop introduction to FAIR, please
think about the following questions.

1. What's the approach of handling sensitive data? Is there a procedure? Links
are useful, or a simple description.
1. Persistent identifiers, any special PIDs that are used by NIF? apart from
DOIs or maybe RAiDs?
1. Are there any special controlled vocabularies to describe metadata?
1. Do you know of any recommendations from journals that you use about where to
store data? any guidelines?
1. If people would like to share data what type of file formats are suggested
or broadly in use ?
1. Any recommendations about license for work features?

Also, please take the time to read this Nature article [Make scientific data FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01720-7) by Stall et al., 2019 [doi: 10.1038/d41586-019-01720-7](doi: 10.1038/d41586-019-01720-7)
