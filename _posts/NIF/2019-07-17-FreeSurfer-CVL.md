Cortical Reconstruction Process using FreeSurfer and the CVL. This workshop was
requested by Sydney Imaging in collaboration with University of Sydney as a
CVL partner. It took place at Charles Perkins Centre on Friday, 19 Jul 2019.

# Introduction to FreeSurfer using the CVL

We use the CVL to get you acquainted with the concepts needed to perform
various modes of analysis and processing of MRI data. The tutorial is designed
to be followed along in a terminal window, where commands can be copy/pasted
into the terminal window.

## Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)

The CVL is a nationally funded software infrastructure collaboration
to make scientific tools for image analysis and processing, available freely
and cloud-ready. The [CVL is also a community](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/about) of experts who support training
and best data management practices.
