CVL Community Code of Conduct
==============================

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are
committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect
our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may
be banned from the community.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and
  supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
  limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
  orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
  political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be considerate**
* **Be respectful**
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**
* **Try to understand why we disagree**

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate
discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including
participants with disabilities.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting Paula Andrea Martinez (p.martinez@uq.edu.au). All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
  include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.
After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the
incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to
how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response
team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint
originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a
different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests
for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
