    "body": "   The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory Community  The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL) community is a group of researchers, university lecturers, and health professionals who engage in developing and maintaining materials for training and practice and encourage best data practices, including the use of the CVL infrastructure.   This website collects tutorials, slides, and exercises developed and  maintained by the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory community.   The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory:     The Characterisation Virtual Laboratory is a free cloud-based virtual desktop workbench to perform   analysis of complex image and microscopy data. It serves to run analyses   in a large computing infrastructure, all embedded in a web browser   accessible using AAF (Australian Access Federation), and connected to a   HPC (high performance computing) infrastructure.   For more information please visit https://cvl. org. au.   CVL Software Tools:   The available tools on the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory are listed under Software and versions documentation.   Virtual Laboratories, like the CVL, can save researchers time as they do not have to create and   maintain their own online environments and software tools.   Virtual Desktop:   Currently the virtual desktop service is provided as a national resource by MASSIVE Multi-Modal Australian Sciences Imaging and Visualisation Environment.    A new deployment of the CVL in Queensland provided by QRISCloud is currently being tested and will become available in next months. Read more about the RCC deployment of the CVL here.   Sign in to CVL:   You can create accounts to use the CVL either in the MASSIVE infrastructure as a national resource, or test the CVL at QRISCloud following these instructions.    Storage:   CVL supports extensions of MyTardis data management platform to support instrument facility data, HPC storage and external storage.   Contact for General enquiries:   Email: MASSIVE helpdesk.        Thank you for your support!    Funding:    The CVL is funded by ARDC and supported by MASSIVE in partnership with Monash University, Microscopy Australia, ANSTO, NIF, and the universities of Sydney, Queensland, Western Australia and Wollongong. As a national resource we welcome users of other institutions who will benefit from using the CVL.    "

Workshop preparation: In preparation for the NIF workshop introduction to FAIR, pleasethink about the following questions.  What’s the approach of handling sensitive data? Is there a procedure? Linksare useful, or a simple description.  Persistent identifiers, any special PIDs that are used by NIF? apart fromDOIs or maybe RAiDs? Are there any special controlled vocabularies to describe metadata? Do you know of any recommendations from journals that you use about where tostore data? any guidelines? If people would like to share data what type of file formats are suggestedor broadly in use ? Any recommendations about license for work features?Also, please take the time to read this Nature article Make scientific data FAIR by Stall et al. , 2019 doi:10. 1038/d41586-019-01720-7 Workshop agenda: Thanks for attending this session hosted by the Characterisation VirtualLaboratory (CVL).
